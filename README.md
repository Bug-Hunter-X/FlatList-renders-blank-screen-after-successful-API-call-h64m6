# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders a blank screen even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue occurs because of improper error handling within the component's lifecycle.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from an API endpoint. The API call is successful, and the data is correctly parsed and set into state. However, the FlatList does not render the data; instead, it shows a blank screen. There are no error messages displayed to guide debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves meticulously handling the loading state, ensuring the data is properly updated, and providing proper feedback to the user in case of errors during data fetching.
